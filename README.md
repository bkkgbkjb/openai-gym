# Personal Repo to learn Reinforcement Learning

## Attention

codes in this repo is for my personal study purpose, not for any _production_ use

## Structure

1. `sutton_barto` contains codes of examples in [RLBook, 2nd](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)
2. `papers` contain codes related to classical RL research papers, e.g. DQN, PPO
3. `utils` contain some helper funcs or class that I find useful

## Performance

Some codes cannot achieve best performance, neither do they strictly follow any official implementation

Also, due to limit of my training resources, I usually don't train my models long enough
